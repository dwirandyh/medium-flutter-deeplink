# Flutter Deeplink with Go Router

Learn how to easily implement routing and deep link handling in your Flutter app with go_router

Deep linking allows you to access a specific part of an app using a web browser link. This link can be used to direct users to specific content within the app, such as events, news updates, and more, and can also pass along custom data, like promotional codes. This is useful when you want to share specific content with someone, rather than just sending them to the appâ€™s homepage to search for it themselves.
